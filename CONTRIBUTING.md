## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

* Follow Google style for docstrings
* Update README.md with any new features
* Add examples for new functionality

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
* Include integration tests for complex features

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
